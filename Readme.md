# yaml4-sass

YAML4-Sass is the official Sass/Compass port of the CSS framework YAML, created and maintained by its developer Dirk Jesse.

YAML ist also availabe in a static CSS version, that can be downloaded at: <http://www.yaml.de>

## Recent Version
yaml4-sass: 4.1.0b

## Quick Start
* **compile once** `compass compile` starts a single run to compile sass/scss files to CSS.
* **edit** `compass watch` starts the watcher that recompiles your sass/scss files on every change.

## Overview
The Sass port is built in a way that allows you to create a fully customized version of YAML's framework files.

The Sass port creates all CSS files in the following folders:

* demos/css/
* docs/assets/css/
* yaml/

Please keep in mind, that the /yaml/ folder also contains serveral JavaScript files. So, don't delete this folder, as it's content is not completely generated by Sass.

## Fork notes

In [my](https://github.com/sengeezer) usual style, the SCSS here wastes less space and by using Compass puts more emphasis on and care into the final product. This version is also English only and features fixed spelling where necessary. ;)
